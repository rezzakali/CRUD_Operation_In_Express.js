In this project,simply I'm try to make a CRUD API using node.js and express.js. In this project I use mongoDB as a Database and use Mongoose(Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data). And here I also use Schema which provides by the mongoose. In this project I'm getting a error when I'm trying to get the data from the database, the error is #Query was already executed and after a few minutes I search google the get the solution.
Thanks
